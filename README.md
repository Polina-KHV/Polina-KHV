### Hi there, I'm Polina🌻


I'm just in the begining of the exciting journey to the world of 💜development💜.  
Now I study on 'Web Development' course in [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/).  
I also exercise in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Polina-KHV), but not pretty regular😅.

I'm planning to practice more, do some tutorials on JS or maybe create my own tiny app with RCA😏.  
So wait for more interesting projects in my profile🌼.

And yes, about hobbies!  
In a free time a practice english (now I reread Harry Potter) and learning korean (i'm a huge fan of k-pop and k-dramas).  
I also love running🏃‍♀️💜
